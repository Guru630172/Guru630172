
Inhertence:-
	we can call the other class function by using the current class reference variable with the help of extends.

Extends(Key):-
		This "extends" key is used to call the parent class properties with child class referene variable without creating an object for parent class.

********>whie we are using the constractor there is no "this" or "super" key word at that time constractor take by default key "super" thyat why this statement excute 2nd statement.


Method Overriding:-

		*>In child class writen the same method prototype but changing the logic.
		*>Overriding is only applicable for methods not for variable.
		*>we can't override the static methods.

	**>By Default object classes is parent class and we getting the other functions from the object class
	**>ToString is a pre-defined class in java.

UpCasting:-
	**>when we assign the child class obect to parent class reference variable.
	**>upcasting we are using only for overriding logics.
About String:-
	String is a sequence of char.
	string is immutable.
	String is predifened class in java.
	String is cantaining the char array.
	string class reference variable print the object data instead of adress






Interface:-
		1.We can't create an object for Interface.
		2.Interface cantains 100% un-implimented functions.
		3.These un-implimented functions are implimented in class.

Abstract:-
		1.We can't create an object for abstract class directly.
		2.We can able to create an object for abstract class with the child class.
		3.abstract classes contain 0 to 100% unimplimented functions.

Access Modifies:-
		1.Private
		2.Default
		3.Protected
		4.Public
